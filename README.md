# ABC-Cars

### The scope of this project is to execute the risk-based test plan and evaluate with its associated outcomes. I had been approached by ‘ABC Cars Pte Ltd’ as a website developer to develop a Used Car Sales portal. Users will be able to register in the portal using the Registration Page. Users of the portal can search for Cars using Make, Model, Registration & Price Range. Users will be able to view the Car information after searching them. The portal allow users to login, post Car for sale.
